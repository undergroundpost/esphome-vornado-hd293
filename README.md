# Vornado HD293 Smart Fan Controller

Transform your Vornado HD293 fan into a smart, remotely controllable device with this ESPHome-based controller. This project replaces the manual speed selection switch with an ESP8266 microcontroller, enabling WiFi control through Home Assistant while maintaining offline functionality with a physical button.

## Features

- **3-Speed Control**: Full control over low, medium, and high fan speeds
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Native ESPHome integration with automatic discovery
- **Manual Control**: Physical button for offline speed cycling
- **Safety Interlocks**: Prevents multiple relays from being active simultaneously
- **Status Monitoring**: WiFi signal strength, uptime, and connection status
- **3D Printed Enclosure**: Custom enclosure design (available on Printables)
- **Over-the-Air Updates**: Easy firmware updates via WiFi

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP8266 D1 Mini** (or compatible)
- **3x Relay Module** (5V, suitable for fan motor switching)
- **Push Button** (momentary, normally open)
- **Vornado HD293 Fan** (disassembled for modification)
- **Jumper wires and connectors**
- **3D Printed Enclosure** (STL files coming soon to Printables)

## Pin Configuration

| Component | ESP8266 Pin | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Push Button | GPIO4 | Manual speed control button |
| Low Speed Relay | GPIO14 | Controls fan low speed |
| Medium Speed Relay | GPIO13 | Controls fan medium speed |
| High Speed Relay | GPIO12 | Controls fan high speed |
| Status LED | GPIO2 | Built-in LED (connection status) |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) installed
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) (optional but recommended)
- Basic electronics knowledge and tools

### Hardware Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This modification involves working with mains voltage. Ensure power is disconnected before making any modifications. If you're not comfortable working with electrical components, please consult a qualified electrician.

1. **Disassemble the Vornado HD293 fan**
   - Remove the original speed selection switch
   - Identify the motor speed taps (typically 3 wires for different speeds)

2. **Install the ESP8266 and relay module**
   - Mount the ESP8266 D1 Mini in the 3D printed enclosure
   - Connect the relay module according to the pin configuration
   - Wire the relays to control the fan motor speed taps

3. **Add the manual control button**
   - Install the push button in an accessible location
   - Connect to GPIO4 with appropriate pull-up resistor (internal pull-up used in code)

### Software Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/undergroundpost/esphome-vornado-hd293.git
   cd vornado-hd293-smart-controller
   ```

2. **Create your secrets file**
   ```bash
   cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
   ```

3. **Edit the secrets file** with your WiFi credentials and encryption keys:
   ```yaml
   wifi_ssid: "YourWiFiNetwork"
   wifi_password: "YourWiFiPassword"
   # ... other secrets
   ```

4. **Flash the ESP8266**
   ```bash
   esphome run vornado-hd293.yaml
   ```

5. **Add to Home Assistant** (if using)
   - The device should be automatically discovered
   - Go to Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome
   - Configure the new device

## Usage

### Manual Control
- **Single button press**: Cycles through fan speeds (Off ‚Üí Low ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí High ‚Üí Off)
- **Long press**: No action (reserved for future features)

### Home Assistant Control
- **Fan Entity**: Control speed and on/off state
- **Sensors**: Monitor WiFi signal strength, uptime, and IP address
- **Automation**: Create custom automations based on temperature, time, etc.

### API Control
The device exposes a REST API for direct control without Home Assistant:
```bash
# Turn on at medium speed
curl -X POST http://device-ip/fan/vornado_fan/turn_on -d '{"speed": 2}'

# Turn off
curl -X POST http://device-ip/fan/vornado_fan/turn_off
```

## Safety Features

- **Relay Interlocks**: Only one speed relay can be active at a time
- **300ms Wait Time**: Prevents relay chatter during speed changes
- **Input Debouncing**: 10ms debounce on button presses
- **Status LED**: Visual indication of device status and connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Device Won't Connect to WiFi
1. Check your `secrets.yaml` file for correct credentials
2. Ensure the device is within WiFi range
3. Look for the fallback hotspot and connect to configure manually

### Fan Doesn't Respond
1. Check relay wiring and connections
2. Verify motor speed taps are correctly identified
3. Test relays individually using Home Assistant or logs

### Button Not Working
1. Check GPIO4 connection and pull-up configuration
2. Monitor logs for button press events
3. Verify button wiring (normally open, momentary)

### Viewing Logs
```bash
esphome logs vornado-hd293.yaml
```

## 3D Printed Enclosure

The custom enclosure STL files will be available on Printables soon. The enclosure features:
- Mounting points for ESP8266 D1 Mini
- Relay module compartment
- Button cutout and mounting
- Ventilation slots
- Cable management

**Print Settings:**
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20%
- Supports: No
- Material: PLA or PETG
